      tool! It makes you independent! It is your knowledge, it is<br />
      your power!”</p>

      <p>Welcome to <b>My Language Laboratory!</b><br />
      Would you like to learn English in order to be independent in your<br />
      travels, work or research? Would you like to travel the world, get to<br />
      know people and dive into different cultures?</p>

      <p>My name is Valeriya Van Hasselt, and I am keen on teaching English.<br />
      I am interested in getting to understand what your personal<br />
      motivation to speak the language is, how you process the material<br />
      the best! We set the goal together and we get to it TOGETHER!<br />
      I believe that language acquisition is more than just drilling a set of<br />
      words and phrases, understanding grammar and being able to<br />
      communicate abroad. </p>

      <p>I strive to let people speak the second language as their first one. I<br />
      value individual approach to teaching. Each person is different as<br />
      his/her way of studying. My purpose is to cover all the aspects of<br />
      the language and make them automatic!<br />
      In order to do that I make lessons interesting and students curious,<br />
      curious to know. </p>

      <p>How I work<br />
      I give a lot of audio and video materials to watch, listen to, process,<br />
      understand, work with, discuss. Listening is how we perceive any<br />
      language at first. Moreover, videos give us an opportunity to include<br />
      pragmatic component into studying process. Most schools do not<br />
      teach it at all which leads to inability to communicate in the country<br />
      of the language or understand humor.<br />
      Not to mention, I believe that grammar has a system and can easily<br />
      be used properly when understood. It only takes time to make its<br />
      use automatic. Reading and writing is a must. You could also<br />
      practise your writing for different purposes.</p>
